# v2 Analytics Modernisation – Tests (integration / pipeline)

This folder exists to keep a clean, predictable project structure.

**What goes here (future / optional)**
- Integration tests for ETL runs (extract → transform → load)
- Data-quality rule tests (rule catalogue sanity checks)
- Schema/view validation tests for the OLTP + warehouse SQL

The repo already contains API unit tests under:
`v2_analytics_modernisation/api_service/tests/`

For now, this folder includes a placeholder file so it is always tracked in ZIP/Git exports.
