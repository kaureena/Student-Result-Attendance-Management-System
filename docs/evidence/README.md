# Evidence pack (supporting artefacts)

This folder contains **supporting evidence** that backs up what is claimed in the documentation and logs.
Keep everything **non-sensitive and synthetic** (no real student/patient/personal data).

Recommended contents (examples)
- Screenshots of successful runs (ETL / DQ / API tests)
- Export samples (sanitised)
- Any small “proof” artefacts referenced from `EVIDENCE_INDEX.md`

Notes
- Large binaries should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
- If you add files here, ensure they are referenced from `EVIDENCE_INDEX.md` so reviewers can trace them.
