# Demo evidence (GIF)

Add **one short animated GIF (10–15 seconds)** showing the project running.
This improves reviewer confidence because it proves the repo is runnable.

Replace `demo_quickstart.gif` with a real screen recording GIF.

Suggested content:
1. Open terminal in repo root
2. Run ETL smoke command
3. Run DQ checks
4. (Optional) Start API and open `/docs`

Tip (Windows):
- Use **ScreenToGif** or **ShareX** to record the screen and export as GIF.
- Keep it short and compressed (aim < 5–8 MB).
